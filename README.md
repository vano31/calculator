# calculator

This calculator project is the final project of The Odin Project's "Foundations" course, which covers HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The Javascript covered includes basic syntax, basic data and variable types, string methods, functions, Objects, and DOM manipulation. 

This is a simple calculator project made from scratch, without assistance from pre-made Youtube tutorials or other people's code. It was a great conglomeration of all of the concepts I learned throughout the Foundations course.
