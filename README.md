# calculator

This calculator project is the final project of The Odin Project's "Foundations" course, which covers HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The Javascript covered includes basic syntax, basic data and variable types, string methods, functions, Objects, and DOM manipulation. 

This is a simple calculator project made from scratch, without assistance from pre-made Youtube tutorials or other people's code. It was a great conglomeration of all of the concepts I learned throughout the Foundations course.

What I had trouble with:
I initially tried to make a graphing calculator with full PEMDAS support, but I was told by other Discord Odin Project followers that doing so required my techniical expertise than what I know now-the official Odin Project instructions stated that I needed to justmake a simple calculator. I was stuck for a long time trying to implement a more advanced version, which derailed my progress.

What I learned:
Although goals can be sky-high, it is important to set expectations small and build upon them iteratively. Doing this will allow you to enjoy the small victories and gain insight on how to solve larger problems. I plan to make a graphing calculator eventually once I have explored Javascript a little more.
